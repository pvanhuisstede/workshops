# workshops

New set of EUR University Library Programming Workshops

At present there are four workshops planned:

1. Writing a scientific article in MarkDown
2. Python introduction (Using notebooks by David Beazley)
3. Python for data science (Using notebooks by Alan Downey)
4. Textmining with Python, Pandas, and SpaCy

## Rationale

A lot of the sources scientists use for their research is available in
an electronic format nowadays. And we have to realize that this is a
lot of an enormous amount of scientific information that is produced
digitally.

The idea is that one can use the computer to process this digital
information. Hence the interest of scientists in learning to program.

But computer programming is a discipline in its own right. Which means
that scientists that program should master two disciplines. But it was
the amount of information in the first place that drove researchers
towards computers and writing software. How to escape this dilemma?

In a certain way it is "dilemmas all the way down". Take for example
the wish of wanting to do textanalysis of a large amount of articles
with the help of the computer. Then the first thing to do is to get
the information. How does one do that? In what formats does it come?
What is the best best format to work with? If I have to extract
information from the downloads, how does one do that? Do we use the
CLI with pipelines of small Sed, Grep, and AWK snippets? We did not do
one second of textanalysis and we already are knee-deep in unknown
programming territory.

Furthermore, given the context of scientific research: open science,
accountability, and reproducibility, the researcher should program in
a certain way, use version control, use sound engineering practices;
in short: the second discipline.

Imagine what could go wrong in the pre-processing data pipelines using
copy-and-paste programming in combination with a couple of flaky
libraries. A sheer horror scenario.

These workshops are not intended to deliver scientific
programmers. The intention is to introduce programming practices,
tools, and problem solving techniques. For this we concentrate on
working with Python and some of its libraries, with Jupyter notebooks,
and using version control.

In the near future we envision multi-disciplinary research groups in
which scientific programmers take part. For researchers particpating
in such groups it becomes more and more important to be able to
clearly communicate what they want.
