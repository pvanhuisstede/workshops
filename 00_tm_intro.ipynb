    "### Jane Austen: Pride and prejudice\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manning book \"Natural Language Processing in Action\" (NLPIA) comes with some example files. These example files are, more often than not, prepared files. In other words, the files are already customized for the software the authors use (for example: Every sentence is on one line (terminated by a newline+) instead of have formatted text that is not wider than 79 characters, each physical line (possibly part of a sentence) ended by a newline+.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NLPIA file is: pride.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "If we open this file in our editor of choice, we \"see\" the formatting. Each sentence in the book is a paragraph, that is there are 2 newlines between sentences (here: sequences of characters terminated by a full stop). There is ONE newline that chops up a book sentence into more or less equal parts to display on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might not seem a big deal at first glance, but there are all sort of possible glitches right from the start. How many book sentences does P&P have? We can count the double newlines. In my editor that gives 1866 book sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our software can only deal with book sentences on one line in our file, what to do? Easy peasy: Just replace single newlines by a space and double newlines by a single newline. *What could go possibly wrong? Can you spot the caveat?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world out there things are different. If we download the Jane Austen ook from Project Gutenberg, we can choose the format. In our case we choose the plain text UTF-8 file.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342\n",
    "\n",
    "If we open this file in our editor, we see something different. The beginning of the first book sentence \"It is a truth universally acknowledged ...\" starts on line 167 in our file. Then the text becomes familiar until the very end where the sequence *** END OF ... signals text added by Project Gutenberg.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NLPIA authors simply removed the Project Gutenberg sandwich around the Jane Austen text, which makes perfect sense if one is going to do textual analysis of that text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It pays off to know the basics of a so-called programming editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Inspect what is there;\n",
    "    - Make some quick necessary changes (re-formatting, deleting the Gutenberg sandwich, etc.) When mistakes are made these editors allow for undo;\n",
    "    - When the file is saved, we save plain text in UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If we were to start with the Project Gutenberg file, we end up with 2 files right at the beginning of our project. We can store the PG file we got from their website as a source file (for example in a directory named \"src\" or \"raw\" and the pre-processed file in another dierctory \"wip\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If one really dives in files in different stages tend to pile up. If that is the case simple version control routines (we use Git) can be of tremendous help. If you reached a certain result, you check that particular result in -- as a snapshot. And just as undo comes in handy, these snapshots can be used to roll back to after you messed up things big time."
